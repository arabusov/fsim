	* configure: Create configure.ac, Makefile.am's, common.mk, and all of the
	COPYING, AUTHORS, README, ChangeLog, NEWS files.
	* plane.cpp: Extend flight model with the attack angle, lifting/drag
	forces for wings, its flaps, its ailerons, elevators, and rudder are
	separated in order to calculate the torque properly. Lifting coefficients
	are calculated using LUT from Wikipedia + cubic splines, thanks GSL. Engine
	force is simply throttle times max power force.
	* plane.hpp: Update.

	* plane.cpp: Begin to write my new flight simulator based on my old code
	from 2008, written in Pascal (that PLANE.PAS file from my mum's aunt PC from
	her cellar).
	* plane.hpp: Create header with the plane_t class description.
